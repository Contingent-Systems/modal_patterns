    abstract = {The PLANNER project is continuing research in natural and
                effective means for embedding knowledge in procedures. In the
                course of this work we have succeeded in unifying the formalism
                around one fundamental concept: the ACTOR. Intuitively, an ACTOR
                is an active agent which plays a role on cue according to a
                script. We use the ACTOR metaphor to emphasize the inseparability
                of control and data flow in our model. Data structures, functions
                , semaphores, monitors, ports, descriptions, Quillian nets,
                logical formulae, numbers, identifiers, demons, processes,
                contexts, and data bases can all be shown to be special cases of
                actors. All of the above are objects with certain useful modes of
                behavior. Our formalism shows how all of these modes of behavior
                can be defined in terms of one kind of behavior: sending messages
                to actors. An actor is always invoked uniformly in exactly the
                same way regardless of whether it behaves as a recursive function
                , data structure, or process.},

                for sequential Java. Foremost, this includes full functional
                verification against contracts written in the Java Modeling
                Language. But the approach is general enough to provide a basis
                for other methods and purposes: (i) complementary validation
                techniques to formal verification such as testing and debugging,
                (ii) methods that reduce the complexity of verification such as
                modularization and abstract interpretation, (iii) analyses of
                non-functional properties such as information flow security, and
                (iv) sound program transformation and code generation. We show
                that deductive technology that has been developed for full
                functional verification can be used as a basis and framework for
                other purposes than pure functional verification. We use the
                current release of the \KeY\ system as an example to explain and
                prove this claim.},

                synchronization in flat combining is so low, that having a single
                thread holding a lock perform the combined access requests of all
                others, delivers, up to a certain non-negligible concurrency
                level, better performance than the most effective parallel finely
                synchronized implementations. We use flat-combining to devise,
                among other structures, new linearizable stack, queue, and

    title = {Verifying Custom Synchronization Constructs Using Higher-Order
             Separation Logic},
    year = {2016},
    month = {January},
    abstract = {Synchronization constructs lie at the heart of any reliable
                concurrent program. Many such constructs are standard (e.g.,
                locks, queues, stacks, and hash-tables). However, many concurrent
                applications require custom synchronization constructs with
                special-purpose behavior. These constructs present a significant
                challenge for verification. Like standard constructs, they rely
                on subtle racy behavior, but unlike standard constructs, they may
                not have well-understood abstract interfaces. As they are custom
                built, such constructs are also far more likely to be unreliable.
                This article examines the formal specification and verification
                of custom synchronization constructs. Our target is a library of
                channels used in automated parallelization to enforce sequential
                behavior between program statements. Our high-level specification
                captures the conditions necessary for correct execution; these
                conditions reflect program dependencies necessary to ensure
                sequential behavior. We connect the high-level specification with
                the low-level library implementation to prove that a client’s
                requirements are satisfied. Significantly, we can reason about
                program and library correctness without breaking abstraction
                boundaries. To achieve this, we use a program logic called iCAP
                (impredicative Concurrent Abstract Predicates) based on
                separation logic. iCAP supports both high-level abstraction and
                low-level reasoning about races. We use this to show that our
                high-level channel specification abstracts three different,
                increasingly complex low-level implementations of the library.
                iCAP’s support for higher-order reasoning lets us prove that
                sequential dependencies are respected, while iCAP’s
                next-generation semantic model lets us avoid ugly problems with
                cyclic dependencies.},

                for fine-grained concurrency, based on a notion of time-stamped
                histories that abstractly capture atomic changes in the program
                state. Our key observation is that histories form a partial
                commutative monoid, a structure fundamental for representation of
                concurrent resources. This insight provides us with a unifying
                mechanism that allows us to treat histories just like heaps in
                separation logic. For example, both are subject to the same
                assertion logic and inference rules (e.g., the frame rule).
                Moreover, the notion of ownership transfer, which usually applies
                to heaps, has an equivalent in histories. It can be used to
                formally represent helping---an important design pattern for
                concurrent algorithms whereby one thread can execute code on
                behalf of another. Specifications in terms of histories naturally
                abstract away the internal interference, so that sophisticated
                fine-grained algorithms can be given the same specifications as
                their simplified coarse-grained counterparts, making them equally
                convenient for client-side reasoning. We illustrate our approach
                on a number of examples and validate all of them in Coq.",

    abstract = {This paper introduces Perennial, a framework for verifying
                concurrent, crash-safe systems. Perennial extends the Iris
                concurrency framework with three techniques to enable
                crash-safety reasoning: recovery leases, recovery helping, and
                versioned memory. To ease development and deployment of
                applications, Perennial provides Goose, a subset of Go and a
                translator from that subset to a model in Perennial with support
                for reasoning about Go threads, data structures, and file-system
                primitives. We implemented and verified a crash-safe, concurrent
                mail server using Perennial and Goose that achieves speedup on
                multiple cores. Both Perennial and Iris use the Coq proof
                assistant, and the mail server and the framework's proofs are
                machine checked.},

    abstract = {We present a Separation Logic with space credits for reasoning
                about heap space in a sequential call-by-value lambda-calculus
                equipped with garbage collection and mutable state. A key
                challenge is to design sound, modular, lightweight mechanisms for
                establishing the unreachability of a block. Prior work in this
                area uses pointed-by assertions to keep track of the predecessors
                of every block, but is carried out in the setting of an
                assembly-like programming language. We take up the challenge in
                the setting of a high-level language, where a key problem is to
                identify and reason about the memory locations that the garbage
                collector considers as roots. For this purpose, we propose novel
                "stackable" assertions, which keep track of the existence of
                stack-to-heap pointers without explicitly recording their origin.
                Furthermore, we explain how to reason about closures -- concrete
                heap-allocated data structures that implement the abstract
                concept of a first-class function. We demonstrate the
                expressiveness and tractability of our program logic via a range
                of examples, including recursive functions on linked lists,
                objects implemented using closures and mutable internal state ,
                recursive functions in continuation-passing style, and three
                stack implementations that exhibit different space bounds. These
                last three examples illustrate reasoning about the reachability
                of the items stored in a container as well as amortized reasoning
                about space. All of our results are proved in Coq on top of Iris.

                by means of a strong ownership-tracking type system. In their
                prior work on RustBelt, Jung et al. began the task of setting
                Rust’s safety claims on a more rigorous formal foundation.
                Specifically, they used Iris, a Coq-based separation logic
                framework, to build a machine-checked proof of semantic soundness
                for a λ-calculus model of Rust, as well as for a number of
                widely-used Rust libraries that internally employ unsafe language
                features. However, they also made the significant simplifying
                assumption that the language is sequentially consistent. In this

                the interoperability rules for its target platforms, including
                data layout and calling conventions, such that compliance with
                the rules ensures “safe” execution and perhaps certain resource
                usage guarantees. These rules are relied upon by compilers,
                libraries, and foreign-function interfaces. Unfortunately, ABIs
                are typically specified in prose, and while type systems for
                source languages have evolved, ABIs have comparatively stalled,
                lacking advancements in expressivity and safety. We propose a
                vision for richer, semantic ABIs to improve interoperability and
                library integration, supported by a methodology for formally
                specifying ABIs using realizability models. These semantic ABIs
                connect abstract, high-level types to unwieldy, but well-behaved,

                accessibility of reference-counted resources using modalities
                inspired by hybrid logic. To highlight the flexibility of our
                methodology, we show how various design decisions can be
                interpreted into the semantic ABI. Finally, we provide the first

    abstract = {As separation logic is a logic of resources, the way in which
                resources can soundly change and be updated is a fundamental
                aspect. Such changes have typically been restricted to certain
                local or frame-preserving updates. However, recently we have seen
                separation logics where the restriction to frame-preserving
                updates seems to be a hindrance towards achieving the ideal
                program reasoning rules. In this, paper we propose a novel
                nextgen modality that enables reasoning across generations where
                each generational change can update resources in ways that are
                non-local and non-frame-preserving. We implement the idea as an
                extension to the Iris base logic, which enriches Iris with an
                entirely new capability: the ability to make non-frame-preserving
                updates to ghost state. We show that two existing Iris modalities
                are special cases of the nextgen modality. Our “extension” can
                thus also be seen as a generalization and simplification of the
                Iris base logic. To demonstrate the utility of the nextgen
                modality we use it to construct a separation logic for a
                programming language with explicit stack allocation and with a
                return operation that clears entire stack frames. The nextgen
                modality is used to great effect in the reasoning rule for return
                , where a modular and practical reasoning rule is otherwise out
                of reach. This is the first separation logic for a high-level
                programming language with stack allocation. We sketch ideas for
                future work in other domains where we think the nextgen modality
                can be useful.},

                the ASM Relational Transducer modeling and property language.
                Then we describe the basic structure of our policy implementation
                and demonstrate the ability to model useful properties in the

                programming in the original language known as the consistent
                update problem. Finally, we describe a reduction from our
                extended language to the original language, and prove it
                satisfies our required correctness property. },

                state transitions over relational structures. This makes them
                promising for modeling system features such as access control,
                especially in an environment where the policy's outcome depends
                on the evolving state of the system. The current notions of

                guarantees of consistency in the face of parallel update
                requests. We present a real-world context that illustrates this
                problem, discuss desirable properties for composition in this

    note = "Undergraduate Thesis",
    abstract = { Garbage collectors are an important part of many modern
                language runtimes. Essentially all tools for developing and
                debugging programs using garbage collection assume the
                correctness of the collector, and therefore provide no means for
                detecting garbage collector errors. As a result it is especially
                important that garbage collector implementations be free of
                errors. This goal is even more challenging in the face of the
                typical implementation strategy for collectors: implementation in
                C, making error-prone inferences from complex bit patterns, where
                an error could result in dereferencing an invalid pointer or
                corrupting program data. One approach to reducing errors in
                collector implementation is to improve both the type-safety and
                memory-safety of garbage collector implementations. Prior work in
                this direction has focused on the use of modern type systems to
                statically detect errors in the collector code at compile time,
                but has practical shortcomings. The prior work replaces the
                standard machine stack with a heap allocated data structure to
                avoid unsafe walks of the native stack. Traversal of the runtime
                stack is normally not possible in higher-level languages because
                they trade the flexibility of arbitrary memory access - typically
                used to gather a root set from a runtime stack - for the safety
                of being unable to cause memory access errors. We present a
                method for addressing the safe stack traversal problem at the
                compiler level, by lifting actual machine stack frames up to the
                level of explicit data structures in Standard ML, such that
                complete stack traversal can be performed with minimal unsafe
                code. We implement a garbage collector in the ML Kit using the
                techniques described and provide details on key parts of the
                implementation. },

                  verifying that multithreaded programs with locks will not
                  deadlock. Most previous work is built around a strict total
                  order on all locks held simultaneously by a thread, but such an
                  invariant often does not hold with fine-grained locking,
                  especially when data-structure mutations change the order locks
                  are acquired. Lock capabilities support idioms that use
                  fine-grained locking, such as mutable binary trees, circular
                  lists, and arrays where each element has a different lock. Lock
                  capabilities do not enforce a total order and do not prevent
                  external references to data-structure nodes. Instead, the
                  technique reasons about static capabilities, where a thread
                  already holding locks can attempt to acquire another lock only
                  if its capabilities allow it. Acquiring one lock may grant a
                  capability to acquire further locks, and in data-structures
                  where heap shape affects safe locking orders, we can use the
                  heap structure to induce the capability-granting relation.
                  Deadlock-freedom follows from ensuring that the
                  capability-granting relation is acyclic. Where necessary, we
                  restrict aliasing with a variant of unique references to allow
                  strong updates to the capability-granting relation, while still
                  allowing other aliases that are used only to acquire locks
                  while holding no locks. We formalize our technique as a
                  type-and-effect system, demonstrate it handles realistic
                  challenging idioms, and use syntactic techniques (type
                  preservation) to show it soundly prevents deadlock. //},

                etc.). However, relatively little of it pays attention to precise
                semantics for languages or tests. Algorithms are described

                existing testing techniques and help to propose new techniques.

                one reference can invalidate assumptions about an alias. We
                present a new type system approach to reasoning about safe
                assumptions in the presence of aliasing and side effects,
                unifying ideas from reference immutability type systems and
                rely-guarantee program logics. Our approach, rely-guarantee
                references, treats multiple references to shared objects
                similarly to multiple threads in rely-guarantee program logics.
                We propose statically associating rely and guarantee conditions
                with individual references to shared objects. Multiple aliases to
                a given object may coexist only if the guarantee condition of
                each alias implies the rely condition for all other aliases. We
                demonstrate that existing reference immutability type systems are
                special cases of rely-guarantee references. In addition to
                allowing precise control over state modification, rely-guarantee
                references allow types to depend on mutable data while still
                permitting flexible aliasing. Dependent types whose denotation is
                stable over the actions of the rely and guarantee conditions for
                a reference and its data will not be invalidated by any action
                through any alias. We demonstrate this with refinement (subset)
                types that may depend on mutable data. As a special case, we
                derive the first reference immutability type system with
                dependent types over immutable data. We show soundness for our

    abstract = { This dissertation proposes a family of techniques for static
                verification of sequential and concurrent imperative programs by
                leveraging fine-grained characterizations of mutation. The key
                idea is that by attaching to each reference in a program (1) a
                restriction on mutations permitted using that reference, and (2)
                a characterization of possible interference through other aliases
                , a type system can reason about what properties are preserved by
                all mutations in a program. This thesis develops four variations
                on this idea: (1) We adapt reference immutability to support
                data-race-free concurrent programming. (2) We generalize
                reference immutability to rely-guarantee references, allowing
                two-state invariants to express usage restrictions between
                read-only and arbitrary mutation. (3) We extend rely-guarantee
                references to prove invariants and functional correctness of
                lock-free concurrent data structures. (4) We evaluate
                rely-guarantee references' utility for existing Haskell programs.
                Together these variations show that reasoning about aliasing and
                reasoning about concurrent (imperative) programs are the same
                fundamental challenge, and that by taking the right foundational
                approach to reasoning about sequential programs, the gap to
                reasoning about concurrent programs is significantly reduced. },

                type systems onto dynamically-typed programming languages, in
                order to improve type safety, programmer productivity, or
                performance. In such cases, type system developers must strike a
                delicate balance between disallowing certain coding patterns to
                keep the type system simple, or including them at the expense of
                additional complexity and effort. Thus far, the process for
                designing retrofitted type systems has been largely ad hoc,
                because evaluating multiple variations of a type system on large
                bodies of existing code is a significant undertaking. We present
                trace typing: a framework for automatically and quantitatively
                evaluating variations of a retrofitted type system on large code
                bases. The trace typing approach involves gathering traces of
                program executions, inferring types for instances of variables
                and expressions occurring in a trace, and merging types according
                to merge strategies that reflect specific (combinations of)
                choices in the source-level type system design space. We
                evaluated trace typing through several experiments. We compared
                several variations of type systems retrofitted onto JavaScript,

                each case on a suite of over fifty thousand lines of JavaScript
                code. We also used trace typing to validate and guide the design
                of a new retrofitted type system that enforces fixed object
                layout for JavaScript objects. Finally, we leveraged the types
                computed by trace typing to automatically identify tag tests -
                dynamic checks that refine a type - and examined the variety of
                tests identified. },

    //abstract = { Ef//fect systems are lightweight extensions to type systems
                  that can verify a wide range of important properties with
                  modest developer burden. But our general understanding of
                  effect systems is limited primarily to systems where the order
                  of effects is irrelevant. Understanding such systems in terms
                  of a lattice of effects grounds understanding of the essential
                  issues, and provides guidance when designing new effect
                  systems. By contrast, sequential effect systems - where the
                  order of effects is important - lack a clear algebraic
                  characterization. We// derive an algebraic characterization
                  from the shape of prior concrete sequential effect systems. We
                  present an abstract polymorphic effect system with singleton
                  effects parameterized by an effect quantale - an algebraic
                  structure with well-defined properties that can model a range
                  of existing order-sensitive effect systems. We define effect
                  quantales, derive useful properties, and show how they cleanly
                  model a variety of known sequential effect systems. We show
                  that effect quantales provide a free, general notion of
                  iterating a sequential effect, and that for systems we consider
                  the derived iteration agrees with the manually designed
                  iteration operators in prior work. Identifying and applying the
                  right algebraic structure led us to subtle insights into the
                  design of order-sensitive effect systems, which provides
                  guidance on non-obvious points of designing order-sensitive
                  effect systems. Effect quantales have clear relationships to
                  the recent category theoretic work on order-sensitive effect
                  systems, but are explained without recourse to category theory.
                  In addition, some of our derived constructs (iteration) should
                  generalize to these semantic structures, addressing limitations
                  of that work. //},

    abstract = { A key challenge for concurrent programming is that side-effects
                (memory operations) in one thread can affect the behavior of
                another thread. In this paper, we present a type system to
                restrict the updates to memory to prevent these unintended
                side-effects. We provide a novel combination of immutable and
                unique (isolated) types that ensures safe parallelism (race
                freedom and deterministic execution). The type system includes
                support for polymorphism over type qualifiers, and can easily
                create cycles of immutable objects. Key to the system's
                flexibility is the ability to recover immutable or externally
                unique references after violating uniqueness without any explicit
                alias tracking. Our type system models a prototype extension to
                C# that is in active use by a Microsoft team. We describe their
                experiences building large systems with this extension. We prove
                the soundness of the type system by an embedding into a program
                logic. },

                subset of JavaScript equipped with objects, structural subtyping,
                prototype inheritance, and first-class methods. The type system
                supports abstract and recursive objects, and is expressive enough
                to accommodate several standard benchmarks with only minor
                workarounds. The invariants enforced by the types enable an
                ahead-of-time compiler to carry out optimizations typically
                beyond the reach of static compilers for dynamic languages.
                Unlike previous inference techniques for prototype inheritance,
                our algorithm uses a combination of lower and upper bound
                propagation to infer types and discover type errors in all code,
                including uninvoked functions. The inference is expressed in a
                simple constraint language, designed to leverage off-the-shelf
                fixed point solvers. We prove soundness for both the type system
                and inference algorithm. An experimental evaluation showed that
                the inference is powerful, handling the aforementioned benchmarks
                with no manual type annotation, and that the inferred types
                enable effective static compilation. },

    abstract = " Optimistic concurrency algorithms provide good performance for
                parallel programs but they are extremely hard to reason about.
                Program logics such as concurrent separation logic and
                rely-guarantee reasoning can be used to verify these algorithms,
                but they make heavy uses of history variables which may obscure
                the high-level intuition underlying the design of these
                algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel program logic that
                uses invariants on history traces to reason about optimistic
                concurrency algorithms. We use past tense temporal operators in
                our assertions to specify execution histories. Our logic supports
                modular program specifications with history information by
                providing separation over both space (program states) and time.
                We verify Michael's non-blocking stack algorithm and show that
                the intuition behind such algorithm can be naturally captured
                using trace invariants.",

                challenge of designing correct and efficient concurrent data
                structures. But verification efforts often ignore memory
                reclamation, which involves nontrivial synchronization between
                concurrent accesses and reclamation. When incorrectly implemented
                , it may lead to critical safety errors such as use-after-free
                and the ABA problem. Semi-automatic safe memory reclamation
                schemes such as hazard pointers and RCU encapsulate the
                complexity of manual memory management in modular interfaces.
                However, this modularity has not been carried over to formal
                verification. We propose modular specifications of hazard
                pointers and RCU, and formally verify realistic implementations
                of them in concurrent separation logic. Specifically, we design
                abstract predicates for hazard pointers that capture the meaning
                of validating the protection of nodes, and those for RCU that
                support optimistic traversal to possibly retired nodes. We
                demonstrate that the specifications indeed facilitate modular
                verification in three criteria: compositional verification,
                general applicability, and easy integration. In doing so, we
                present the first formal verification of Harris’s list, the
                Harris-Michael list, the Chase-Lev deque, and RDCSS with
                reclamation. We report the Coq mechanization of all our results
                in the Iris separation logic framework.},
